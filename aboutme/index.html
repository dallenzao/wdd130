        <p>Hello! To introduce myself, I am a Computer Information Technology Major, and am from Billerica, Massachusetts (Just north of Boston). 
            I am a transfer student, and this is my 3rd semester here at BYU-Idaho. I recently got off my mission serving as a service missionary
            in the Boston area. I did lots of service in food pantries, animal shelters, nursing homes, as well as serving as an ordinance worker
            in the Boston Temple. I also served as the teaching mission technology specialist for the time I was serving, as well as serving at
            the churches Global Services Department. 
        </p>
        <p>I have a huge passion for technology. I particularly like opening devices, learning and seeing how they work, as well as repairing
            them. In 2019 I got a job working in sales of used computers and handheld devices, as well as learned how to professionally repair them.
            On my mission I repaired all the missionaries phones when they would crack the screens, the batteries would die, etc. I also love building
            desktop PCs. Ive built countless machines for clients, family, friends, as well as myself. I love learning about all the new technology and
            hardware thats being released, as well as helping people learn about it as well. I also have a cat Russell, who I adopted while on my
            mission. Hes quite the little ball of energy, but hes super sweet and loves following me around.
        </p>

            I am excited to get to know all of you, and to learn about web development! Thanks for reading.
