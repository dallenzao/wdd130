        The home page will also have a catchy headline, a logo and some images that showcase the quality and variety of products and services available.

      <h3>Custom PCs / Repairs</h3>
      <p>
        There will be 2 pages for 2 separate services. One service will be to configure a custom PC, while another will be to request a repair on a device.
        The Custom PC page will give possible configurations based on different categories such as gaming, work or entertainment. It will also have a form 
        with some questions that ask for the users contact info, budget, size, color, specific preferences on parts and brands etc. The form will allow 
        users to customize their PC according to their needs and preferences. The Repairs page will give a list of possible devices that can be repaired 
        such as laptops, tablets or smartphones. It will also have another subpage within it that will give some pricing on common repairs such as phone
        screens and batteries. The pricing will be transparent and competitive with other repair shops in the area. There will also be a contact form
        requesting information on the device model number, what happened and what repair is wanting to be completed as well as their contact information.
        The form will help users get an estimate of the cost and time required for their repair.
