                <p id="waterpg"> It may not seem like it but this person is falling to their uncertain doom, as the 
                    water isnt actually water but an illusion of his imagination. Thats gonna hurt. Like seriously, poor mans gonna fall and
                    that glass is many feet thick, it aint gonna break. The only thing thats gonna break is that poor mans self esteem and maybe
                    most of the bones in his body. 
                    The man had been walking along a path through a seemingly idyllic landscape, completely unaware that his surroundings were actually a product of his own mind. He had been struggling with depression for a long time, and this internal world was a manifestation of his subconscious thoughts and fears. Despite its apparent beauty, the man was unable to escape the constant sense of impending doom that pervaded his mind.
                    As he approached the edge of the path, he became increasingly aware of the vast, dark chasm stretching out before him. Despite knowing that the water was an illusion, the man still felt a sense of vertigo and dread as he looked down into the seemingly endless void. He tried to take a step back, but his legs wouldn't listen, and he found himself teetering on the edge, unable to regain his balance.The man's mind raced as he fell, his thoughts tumbling over each other in a frantic attempt to make sense of what was happening. He had heard stories of people trapped in their own minds, unable to escape the illusions that they had created for themselves, but he had never believed that it could happen to him. Now, as he fell towards the glass-like surface of the water, he realized that he was living one of those stories.
                    As he plummeted towards the ground, the man felt a crushing sense of despair. He had always known that he was susceptible to bouts of depression, but he had never imagined that it would be something that could control him in such a profound way. He felt a moment of regret as he thought of all the things he had left undone, all the opportunities that he had missed.
                    When he finally hit the ground, the man was shocked to find that the glass didn't break. Instead, he bounced back up, unharmed but disoriented. He looked around, and saw that the world around him was starting to fade, the colors becoming more muted and the edges becoming blurry. He realized that he was slowly waking up from the dream, and he felt a sense of relief that he would soon be free of the dark world that he had created.
                    As he came back to reality, the man realized that he needed to seek help for his depression. He knew that it was something that he couldn't face alone, and that he needed to find someone who could guide him through the process of healing. He took a deep breath, and slowly made his way towards the door, determined to start on the road to recovery.
